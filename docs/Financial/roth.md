# Roth Practices

## What is a Roth Account?

When you contribute to a Roth IRA you pay taxes on the money you contribute today, but benefit from letting those contributions grow tax-free. If you intend to contribute large sums to your retirement, a Roth IRA may help you save more money in the long run.

- **No required minimum distributions**: Account holders of Roth IRAs aren't subject to the required minimum distributions required of traditional IRA or 401(k) accounts (Beginning in 2023, these RMDs must start at age 73.) This means account holders don't have to take distributions from a Roth IRA at any point while they're alive, unlike with traditional IRAs or 401(k)s
- **No income tax on inherited Roth IRAs**: If you pass a Roth IRA to a heir, they enjoy tax-free withdrawals as long as the account was held for at least five years at the time of the account holder's death.

- **Easy withdrawals**: You can withdraw the money you contributed any time, without taxes or penalty. (You may be taxed or penalized if you withdraw investment earnings.)
- **Double dipping**: You can contribute to a Roth IRA in addition to an employer retirement account like a 401(k).
- **Flexible timing:** You can choose when and how much you contribute to a Roth IRA. For example, you could contribute the full limit on the first day of the year, or split up your contributions throughout the year.
- **Extra time to contribute**: You have until that year's tax deadline to contribute for the previous calendar year, which usually falls in mid-April.
- **Tax-free distributions**: Once you hit 59½, and have held the account for at least five years, you can take distributions, including earnings, from a Roth IRA without paying federal taxes.
- **\*No age limit to open**: You can open a Roth IRA at any age, as long as you have earned income (you can’t contribute more than your earned income).
