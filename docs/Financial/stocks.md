# Stock Practices

- **What Is Value Investing?**: Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.
- **Understanding Value Investing**: The basic concept behind everyday value investing is straightforward: If you know the true value of something, you can save a lot of money when you buy it on sale.
- **Intrinsic Value and Value Investing**: Investors use various metrics to attempt to find the valuation or intrinsic value of a stock. Intrinsic value is a combination of using financial analysis such as studying a company's financial performance, revenue, earnings, cash flow, and profit as well as fundamental factors, including the company's brand, business model, target market, and competitive advantage.

  - **_Price-to-book (P/B)_**or book value
  - **_Price-to-earnings (P/E)_**:, which shows the company's track record for earnings to determine if the stock price is not reflecting all of the earnings or is undervalued.
  - **_Free cash flow_**:, which is the cash generated from a company's revenue or operations after the costs of expenditures have been subtracted.
  - **_Margin of Safety_**: Value investors require some room for error in their estimation of value, and they often set their own "margin of safety," based on their particular risk tolerance. The margin of safety principle, one of the keys to successful value investing, is based on the premise that buying stocks at bargain prices gives you a better chance at earning a profit later when you sell them.

- **_Markets Are Not Efficient_**: Value investors don’t believe in the efficient-market hypothesis, which says that stock prices already take all information about a company into account, so their price always reflects their value. Instead, value investors believe that stocks may be over- or underpriced for a variety of reason
- **_Don't Follow the Herd_**: they don’t follow the herd
