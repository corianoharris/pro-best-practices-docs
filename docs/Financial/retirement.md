# Retirement Practices

- Save 25% % a Year: Fund a stable retirement by saving 25% of household income annually.
- Save for the Biggest Expenses:
  - **_Housing_**: Buying or renting only as much space as you actually need, and in locations that are not highly priced, can free up hundreds of dollars each month.
  - **_Transpoprtation_**: The key to driving down these costs: Buy small to buying a midsize fuel-efficient vehicles, and keep them for 10 to 15 years. Getting a car to 200,000 miles saves $30,000 on average, according to Consumer Reports
  - **_Food_**: According to the Department of Agriculture, Americans waste 30% of the food they buy. Since the average household devotes 13% of its budget to food, thatâ€™s almost 4% of annual earnings going in the trash.
- **Maximize Your Retirement Accounts**: Roth IRA/401(k)/403(b)/TSP: You receive no tax benefits on contributions, but investment returns and withdrawals are tax-free as long as you follow the rules.

- **Invest for the Long-Term Now**: You can set your portfolio up for success by choosing investments that have attractive long-term returns.

  - Large-cap stocks (such as those found in the S&P 500): 10.2% average annualized returns
  - Government bonds: 5.5% average annualized returns
  - Treasury bills (essentially cash): 3.3% average annualized returns

- **Take Advantage of Catch Up Contributions**:

- **Budget for a Long Retirement**:
  - A secure retirement starts with leaving the workforce only when you truly have enough resources.
  - While research has found that approximately 50% of those who retire at age 65 will have to cut back on their lifestyles, that percentage drops to just 15% for those who retire at age 70.
