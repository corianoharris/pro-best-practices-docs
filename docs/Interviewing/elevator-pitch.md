# Work Value

## Elevator Pitch

I have over 5 years experience in client-side development, research, and design. As well as several years as a UX researcher and UI designer. Therefore I bring a unique combination of technical and design expertise to my work, allowing me to create intuitive and user-friendly software applications. With a background in computer science and a passion for user experience, I understand the importance of designing software that not only meets technical requirements but also meets the needs and expectations of its users. As a UX researcher, I conducted user interviews, surveys, and usability tests to gather insights into user behavior and preferences. With this information, I worked closely with the development team to create user-centered designs that enhance the overall user experience. Whether I'm writing code, designing interfaces, or conducting user research, I'm dedicated to creating software that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
