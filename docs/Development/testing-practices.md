# Testing Practices

- Test early and often: Start testing as early as possible in the development cycle and continue to test throughout the process to identify and address issues early on.

- Automate testing where possible: Automate tests that are repetitive or time-consuming to ensure that they are consistently executed and reduce the risk of human error.

- Test in multiple environments: Test your software in multiple environments, including development, staging, and production, to ensure that it works correctly in all scenarios.

- Use realistic data: Use realistic data when testing your software to ensure that it accurately reflects real-world scenarios.

- Use a variety of testing techniques: Use a variety of testing techniques, including unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing, to thoroughly test all aspects of your software.

- Conduct exploratory testing: Conduct exploratory testing to identify unexpected issues or potential usability issues that may not be caught by automated tests.

- Use version control: Use version control to track changes to your code and ensure that you can roll back to a previous version if necessary.

- Have a testing strategy: Have a testing strategy in place that outlines the types of tests to be conducted and when they should be conducted to ensure that testing is thorough and consistent.

- Collaborate with stakeholders: Collaborate with stakeholders, including developers, testers, and users, to ensure that testing is aligned with business requirements and user expectations.

- Monitor performance: Monitor performance metrics, such as response times and resource utilization, to identify potential performance issues and proactively address them.

- **Static Types**: Catch typos and type errors
- **Unit Types**: Test individual and isolated parts work correctly
- **Intergration Types**: Tests that several units work together in harmony
- **End 2 End Types**: A helper robot that behaves like a user to click and interact with the application and verify it's functioning correctly.

- I will added another Type
  - Accessiblity Types: Test that units are inclusive to all types of users
