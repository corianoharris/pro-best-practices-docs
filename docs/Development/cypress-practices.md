# Cypress Practices

[Cypress Docs](https://devdocs.io/cypress/)

- Write clean and maintainable code: Write clear, concise, and modular code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Use descriptive and meaningful names for your tests and test components.

- Use Cypress commands instead of traditional DOM queries: Cypress provides a rich set of commands to interact with web elements, which is much easier to use and provides better error handling than traditional DOM queries.

- Use fixtures for data: Use fixtures to store test data instead of hardcoding data in the test scripts. This helps in making the test data easily maintainable and reusable.

- Use custom commands: Create custom commands to encapsulate commonly used functionality or interactions with your application. This reduces code duplication and increases maintainability.

- Use aliases: Use aliases to store references to web elements and then reuse them across multiple tests. This reduces the time required to search for the same element again and again.

- Use timeouts effectively: Set appropriate timeouts for Cypress commands to avoid unnecessary delays in the test execution. It is important to set an appropriate timeout for each command to ensure that the test runs smoothly.

- Use proper assertions: Use proper assertions to ensure that the expected behavior of the application is achieved. Assertions should be specific and clear, and should not be too generic.

- Use Cypress Studio for visual testing: Use Cypress Studio to visually record and replay tests. This helps in creating tests quickly and also makes it easy to update them when the application changes.

- Use beforeEach and afterEach hooks: Use beforeEach and afterEach hooks to perform setup and cleanup actions before and after each test. This helps in maintaining a clean and consistent state for the test environment.

- Use Cypress Dashboard for test reporting: Use Cypress Dashboard to monitor test results and analyze trends. This helps in identifying issues and taking corrective actions quickly.
