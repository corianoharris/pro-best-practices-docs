# Nextjs Practices

[Next Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference)

- Use server-side rendering (SSR) for better performance: Next.js supports SSR out of the box, which can help improve the performance of your web application. SSR allows your application to load faster and improve SEO by serving fully rendered HTML to the client.

- Optimize for performance: Next.js provides several built-in optimizations for performance, such as automatic code splitting, lazy loading, and pre-fetching. Use these features to ensure your application loads quickly and efficiently.

- Use the file-based routing system: Next.js provides a file-based routing system, which allows you to define your routes in the file system rather than in a separate configuration file. Use this feature to keep your code organized and easy to navigate.

- Use dynamic imports for code splitting: Next.js supports dynamic imports, which can be used to split your code into smaller chunks and load them only when needed. Use dynamic imports to improve the performance of your application and reduce the initial load time.

- Use the API routes for serverless functions: Next.js provides API routes, which allow you to define serverless functions that can be deployed to serverless platforms like AWS Lambda. Use API routes to build lightweight and scalable serverless functions for your application.

- Use the built-in CSS support: Next.js provides built-in support for CSS, allowing you to import CSS files directly into your components. Use this feature to keep your styles organized and easy to maintain.

- Use environment variables for configuration: Next.js provides support for environment variables, which can be used to store configuration information like API keys and database URLs. Use environment variables to keep sensitive information secure and separate from your code.

- Use TypeScript for type safety: Next.js supports TypeScript out of the box, allowing you to use strong typing to catch errors before they occur. Use TypeScript to improve the maintainability and scalability of your codebase.

- Use a consistent file structure: Use a consistent file structure to keep your code organized and easy to navigate. Follow the best practices for React file structure and adapt them to Next.js.

- Use tooling to enforce best practices: Use tools like ESLint, Prettier, and Next.js plugins to enforce best practices for coding style, performance, and accessibility. This helps maintain consistency and improves code quality over time.

## Nextjs Best Practices File Structure

**Using the same file structure**: [Structure and Organize a ReactUsing Application](https://www.taniarascia.com/react-architecture-directory-structure/)

Group files by feature or module: Organize your files based on the features or modules they belong to. This makes it easier to locate related files and maintain the codebase over time.

Use a consistent naming convention: Use a consistent naming convention for your files and folders to make them easy to find and understand. For example, you could use lowercase filenames with hyphens to separate words (e.g. my-feature.js).

Use the built-in pages directory for routing: Next.js provides a built-in pages directory that maps to the routes of your application. Use this directory to create your application's pages and keep your routing organized.

Use a separate components directory for reusable components: Create a separate directory for your reusable components, which can be used across your application. This helps keep your codebase organized and makes it easier to maintain and update these components over time.

Use a separate lib directory for utilities and functions: Use a separate directory for your utility functions, which can be used across your application. This makes it easier to manage and update these functions over time.

Use a separate public directory for static assets: Use a separate directory for your static assets like images, videos, and fonts. This directory should be publicly accessible and is served directly by the web server.

Use a separate styles directory for your stylesheets: Use a separate directory for your stylesheets and organize them based on the components they apply to. This makes it easier to maintain and update your styles over time.

Use a separate api directory for serverless functions: Use a separate directory for your serverless functions, which can be deployed as serverless functions on platforms like AWS Lambda. This directory should contain API routes that handle serverless requests.

Use a separate test directory for your tests: Use a separate directory for your tests, which should be organized based on the features or modules they test. This makes it easier to locate and run your tests over time.

Use tooling to enforce best practices: Use tools like ESLint and Prettier to enforce best practices for file naming, structure, and organization. This helps maintain consistency and improves code quality over time.
