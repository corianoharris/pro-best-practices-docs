# Comments Practices

- **Make them brief**
- **Keep them relevant**
- **Use them liberally, but not to excess**
- **When Header Comments Are Useful**: Header comments are useful in source code for simple explanations of what to expect in that file.
- **A comment before the function (or element) is good for organization and clarity**
- **It’s Okay to Put Warnings in Source Code Comments**: If you have something that you know for a fact won’t work and that you know other people will likely try in the future, it’s okay to warn them about it.
