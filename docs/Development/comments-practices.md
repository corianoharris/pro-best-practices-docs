# Comments Practices

- Use clear and concise language: Use simple and clear language to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. Avoid using technical jargon or overly complex language.

- Comment for the reader: Write comments with the understanding that someone else may read the code in the future. Make sure that the comments add value to the code and explain what the code is doing.

- Comment what, not how: Comments should explain what the code is doing, not how it is doing it. The code should be self-explanatory, and comments should clarify any ambiguities or explain the reasoning behind certain decisions.

- Avoid redundant comments: Avoid adding comments that are redundant or repeat what is already clear from the code itself. For example, "this variable stores the user's name" is unnecessary if the variable is named "userName".

- Use consistent formatting: Use consistent formatting for comments, such as a consistent margin or indentation. This makes the comments easier to read and understand.

- Comment edge cases and assumptions: Comment any edge cases or assumptions that are relevant to the code. This can help other developers understand the limitations or conditions under which the code is expected to work.

- Update comments as needed: Keep comments up-to-date as the code changes. If the code functionality changes, make sure that the comments reflect those changes.
