# JavaScript Practices

[MDN ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

- Use modern JavaScript features: JavaScript is constantly evolving, so use the latest language features that are supported by modern browsers and Node.js versions.

- Use a linter: Use a linter like ESLint to catch common coding errors and enforce consistent coding style and best practices.

- Avoid global variables: Limit the use of global variables, as they can cause naming collisions and make it difficult to maintain code.

- Use arrow functions: Use arrow functions to write shorter and more concise code, especially for callback functions.

- Use async/await: Use async/await to write asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain.

- Avoid using eval: Avoid using eval() as it can introduce security risks and make code more difficult to debug.

- Use strict mode: Use "use strict" to enable strict mode, which can help catch common coding errors and improve performance.

- Optimize performance: Optimize the performance of your JavaScript code by minimizing network requests, using lazy loading, and reducing the number of DOM manipulations.

- Follow industry-standard best practices: Follow industry-standard best practices, such as those recommended by the JavaScript community and popular frameworks like React and Airbnb.
