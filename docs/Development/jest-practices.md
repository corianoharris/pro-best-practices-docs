# Jest Practices

[Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/)

- Write clean and maintainable code: Write clear, concise, and modular code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Use descriptive and meaningful names for your tests and test components.

Use beforeEach and afterEach hooks: Use beforeEach and afterEach hooks to perform setup and cleanup actions before and after each test. This helps in maintaining a clean and consistent state for the test environment.

Use describe and it functions to organize tests: Use describe and it functions to group and organize your tests. This makes it easier to understand the intent of each test suite and to quickly identify failing tests.

Use mock functions: Use Jest's built-in mocking features to create mock functions for dependencies and external resources. This helps in isolating the code being tested and makes the tests faster and more reliable.

Use snapshot testing: Use Jest's snapshot testing feature to test the output of components and functions. This helps in detecting unexpected changes in the code and ensures that the application output remains consistent.

Use expect assertions: Use Jest's expect assertions to ensure that the expected behavior of the application is achieved. Assertions should be specific and clear, and should not be too generic.

Use coverage reports: Use Jest's coverage reports to analyze the code coverage of your tests. This helps in identifying areas of your code that are not being tested adequately.

Use test matchers: Use Jest's built-in test matchers to create tests that match specific conditions or behaviors. This helps in creating more targeted and focused tests.

Use environment variables: Use environment variables to manage sensitive data or configurations that are specific to the test environment. This helps in keeping the code clean and portable.

Use Jest configuration files: Use Jest configuration files to customize the behavior of the testing framework. This helps in creating a consistent and reliable testing environment, and allows for easy integration with other tools and systems.
