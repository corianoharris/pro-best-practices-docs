[MDN Html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

- **Use semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML tags to improve the accessibility and SEO of the website. This means using tags that accurately describe the content, such as [header, nav, main, footer], etc.

- **Use a consistent naming convention**: Use a consistent naming convention for classes, IDs, and other attributes to make it easier to read and understand the code. This can also make it easier to search for specific elements in the code.

- **Use valid HTML**: Use valid HTML code that conforms to the latest standards. This can help ensure that the code is compatible with different browsers and devices.

- **Use indentation and formatting**: Use proper indentation and formatting to make the code more readable and easier to understand.

- **Use comments effectively**: Use comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code. This can make it easier for other developers to understand and update the code.

- **Optimize for performance**: Optimize the HTML code for performance by reducing the number of requests and minimizing the file size. This can improve the page load time and user experience.

- **Test the code thoroughly**: Test the HTML code thoroughly across different browsers and devices to ensure that it displays correctly and is consistent.

- **Use responsive design**: Use responsive design to ensure that the website is accessible and displays correctly across different screen sizes and devices.-
