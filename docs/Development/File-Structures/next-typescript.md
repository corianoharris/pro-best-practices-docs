# File Breakdown

- **pages**: Contains the individual pages or routes of your application. Each file in this folder represents a separate page or route.

- **components**: Holds reusable UI components that are used across multiple pages. Components can be organized into subfolders based on their functionality or purpose.

- **layouts**: Contains layout components that define the overall structure of a page. Layout components can be reused across multiple pages and often include common elements like headers and footers.

- **api**: Houses serverless API routes. Each file in this folder represents an individual API endpoint and handles API requests.

- **utils**: Stores utility functions or helper modules used throughout the application.

- **styles**: Contains global styles, CSS modules, or other styling-related files.

- **public:** Holds static assets such as images, fonts, or other files that need to be publicly accessible.

- **types**: Stores TypeScript type definitions and interfaces used throughout the application for improved type safety and manageability.-
