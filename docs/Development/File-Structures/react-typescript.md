## File Breakdwon

- **src**: This directory contains the source code of your application.

  - **components**: This directory houses reusable components that are used across different pages. Component1: Each component can have its own folder containing the component file (Component1.tsx), its corresponding styled-components file (Component1.styles.ts), and its unit test file (Component1.test.tsx). Component2 ...
  - **pages**: Refer to the components that represent individual views or screens within the application.
  - **hook**s: This directory contains custom hooks that provide reusable functionality for your components. Each hook is placed in its own file (useCustomHook1.ts, useCustomHook2.ts, etc.).
  - **context**: This directory contains context providers that manage global state for your application using React Context API. Each context provider is placed in its own file (ContextProvider1.tsx, ContextProvider2.tsx, etc.).
  - **constants**: This directory contains files (constants1.ts, constants2.ts, etc.) where you can define constant values used in your application.

    - **unit**: This directory contains unit tests for individual components or utilities. Each test file should focus on testing a specific component or utility in isolation.
  - **Cypress**: This directory houses end-to-end test files using Cypress. Each test file **(\*.spec.ts)** contains end-to-end test scenarios that simulate user interactions and verify the behavior of your application.
  - **package.json**: The file that manages project dependencies and scripts.
  - **prettier.config.js**: The configuration file for Prettier, specifying code formatting rules.
