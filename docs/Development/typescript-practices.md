# TypeScript Practices

- Use strict mode: Enable strict mode in your TypeScript configuration to catch common coding errors and improve performance.

- Use type annotations: Use type annotations to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values to catch type errors at compile time.

- Use interfaces and types: Use interfaces and types to define custom types and reduce duplication in your code.

- Use enums and constants: Use enums and constants to define a set of values that are used throughout your code.

- Use optional and default parameters: Use optional and default parameters to provide flexibility in function calls and reduce the number of function overloads.

- Use generics: Use generics to write reusable code that can work with different types.

- Use readonly properties: Use readonly properties to prevent accidental modification of values and improve code clarity.

- Use nullish coalescing and optional chaining: Use nullish coalescing (??) and optional chaining (?.) to safely access optional properties and handle null and undefined values.

- Use code analysis tools: Use code analysis tools like ESLint and TSLint to enforce consistent coding style and catch common coding errors.

- Write unit tests: Write unit tests to ensure that your TypeScript code works as expected and catches regressions early on.
