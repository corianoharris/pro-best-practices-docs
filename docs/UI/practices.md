# UI Design Practices

Help create a user-friendly and effective interface that meets the needs of the users and the business.

- **Do Not Put Everything in a Single Screen**: Putting all of the application’s menus, features, and buttons in a single screen is a bad UX practice

  - **_Avoid Overwhelming Design_**: Your brain can only understand nine options at a time at best. And let’s be honest, the end-user may not use 90% of your app’s buttons that often, so there is no need to overwhelm them

  - **_Prioritize Visual Proximity_**: Buttons should be close to the data that they influence. This means that when you have fewer buttons on one screen, you gain visual proximity.

  - **_Remember, Users Do Not Hate Scrolling!_**: Placing more information higher on the page does not mean the end-user will necessarily absorb that information. It may make them tire of your app more quickly and even leave.

- **Do Not Put Everything in Drop-Down Menus**:

  - **_Emphasize Balance_**: Think about your interface as a physical space.

- **Let the User Know Where They Are in the App**: When your app has a consistent design system and brand style, all the pages may start to feel the same to the end-user.

  - **_Design for Distracted Users_**: The last thing on their mind is what link they just clicked and where they are in the flow of your app.

- **Avoid Long Lines and Tiny Text**: The rule of thumb for web typography is to write no more than nine words per line. When the end-user is finished reading a line, their eyes need to be able to find the next line. So, if a line is too long, it is harder for their eyes to move on.

  - **_Whitespace Is Not Wasted Space_**: Do Not Double Up the Pop-Ups

- **Do Not Double Up the Pop-Ups**: The end-user will lose the mental model of where they are in the flow of app pages or the process. They will be more distracted, no matter if they close the second pop-up window and return to the first pop-up window or return to the original screen

  - **_Avoid One Too Many Pop-Up Windows_**: Avoid One Too Many Pop-Up Windows: Turn the first pop-up window into a page itself, or convert the second pop-up window into an inline message in the first pop-up window

- **Lay Your Cards on the Table**: When you nest a card inside another card, the end-user’s mental model of what you can do with the cards starts to break down. This end-user may even start to question the relationships of other objects in the UI, thus further compromising the design hierarchy in your app.

  - **_Do Not Nest Card_**: Place them next to each other.

- **Plan Your Forms Carefully**: How many form fields are visible on the screen at a single time? Like buttons, the number of form fields should be reduced to the minimal number possible that can still provide context and ease-of-use.

  - **_Always Use a Single Colum_**: The best practice for designing forms is to put input fields in a single column. This will make it easier for the end-user to continue their flow down the page and check off each section

  - **_Think About the Story You Are Telling_**: When you think about the story you are telling, look for the best points to break up your forms into multiple pages. Doing so will give you visual space to create breathing room for the end-user and explain to them what they are doing and why it is important.

  - **_Consider What Should Go in Drop-Down Menus_**: If there are only 2–5 form field items to choose from, do not put them in a drop-down menu. This might seem like an elegant solution, but it will not be worth the user’s effort and clicks. Placing radio buttons is a friendlier approach.

- **Make the Purpose of Each Button Clear**: Consistency in button design is important for enabling the user to progress through your app smoothly

  - **Plan the Position, Color, and Label**: The rule of thumb for button design is that, when the end-user moves forward in an app flow, that button should be designed in the following way:
    - It should be on the right
    - It should have the color green
    - It should have a label that explains what it does (for example, “Accept,” “Proceed,” or “Order”)
    - For “destructive tasks,” such as when the end-user wants to cancel a subscription. In this scenario, you would need to consider whether the button label should be “Cancel” or “Cancel subscription.
